# Building an OCR solution for document analysis with AWS Textract and AWS StepFunctions.

In this post, I’ll talk about AWS Textract and AWS Step Functions and how they could combine to build remarkable solutions like a serverless OCR (Optical character recognition) processor, useful for Tables extraction, like Bank Extracts, Invoices or SpreadSheets for instance. But you can add to this as much “sugar” as you want to process any other type of files with different structures. I invite you to check my poc-pdf-textract repository on GitHub to know more and share your solutions and questions at @gabrieltorreswm on Twitter.
